1.2.0
Enhancements:
* A new search operator, :, now enables capturing slices of Arrays (by 0-based
  element number) and Hashes (by alphanumeric key-name).  This looks like:
  "some::array[2:15]" or "some::hash[beta:gamma]".
* yaml-get now returns JSON instead of "pretty Python" data objects when the
  search returns complex data types (Arrays and Hashes).  This change makes the
  result more portable to non-Python consumers and ensures the result will be
  one per line.
* The separator used for identifying Hash sub-keys can now be customized.  If
  you prefer your paths to look like "/hash/sub/key" rather than "hash.sub.key",
  you can now have it your way.  For now, only . and / are allowed.  The
  seperator cab be either strictly specified or automatically inferred by
  whether the first character of a given YAML Path is /.  Command-line tools
  like yaml-get and yaml-set have a new --pathsep argument for this; the default
  is "auto" and can be set to "/" or ".".

Bug Fixes:
* EYAML on Windows now works when a batch file is used to wrap the Ruby `eyaml`
  command.

1.1.1
Bug fixes:
* The . search operand was limited to only Hash key-names; it now also enables
  searching Array elements.

1.1.0
Added support for Regular Expressions as a search mechanism against Hash keys
and values.  Also increased unit test coverage and fixed some bugs in that
effort.

1.0.0
Initial release.  All features are belived to be working as expected, backed by
comprehensive unit tests and my own in-production use of the bundled
command-line tools.  Of course, not all edge-cases can be predicted, so if you
manage to find a bug, please report it!  Feature requests are always welcome, as
well.  That said, Pull Requests are always the best way to contribute!
