1.0.0
Initial release.  All features are belived to be working as expected, backed by
comprehensive unit tests and my own in-production use of the bundled
command-line tools.  Of course, not all edge-cases can be predicted, so if you
manage to find a bug, please report it!  Feature requests are always welcome, as
well.  That said, Pull Requests are always the best way to contribute!
