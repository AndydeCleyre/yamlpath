1.1.2
Bug fixes:
* When the YAML Path is fully quoted -- a known side-effect of using Jenkins and
  trying to responsibly quote any part of an argument to a shell command -- the
  visual feedback failed to show the user that the parsed version of the YAML
  Path was (correctly) treated as one whole KEY.  While this is not what most
  users should expect, it is correct because YAML Path cannot safely make any
  assumptions as to whether the quoting was deliberate or unintentional.  Now,
  the stringified version of affected YAML Paths very clearly injects escape
  symbols for otherwise intentional special symbols, clearly alerting the user
  that a probable issue is afoot.
* When instructed to `--save` old values, the yaml-set binary was saving only
  decrypted versions of the original values.  It now preserves the original
  encrypted form while still performing other requested or necessary tests
  against the decrypted value.

1.1.1
Bug fixes:
* The . search operand was limited to only Hash key-names; it now also enables
  searching Array elements.

1.1.0
Added support for Regular Expressions as a search mechanism against Hash keys
and values.  Also increased unit test coverage and fixed some bugs in that
effort.

1.0.0
Initial release.  All features are belived to be working as expected, backed by
comprehensive unit tests and my own in-production use of the bundled
command-line tools.  Of course, not all edge-cases can be predicted, so if you
manage to find a bug, please report it!  Feature requests are always welcome, as
well.  That said, Pull Requests are always the best way to contribute!
